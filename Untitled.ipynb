    "### Background Study\n",
    "\n",
    "Tourism play a singificant role in Tanzania's economy. The country has several tourist sights with about 38% of the land area set aside for conservation. It is the only country in the world that has allocated more than 25% of its total area for Wildlife, National Parks and Protected Areas. The country has 16 national partks,  44 game controlled areas, 28 game reserves, 2 marine parks and one conservation area. THe highest mountain in Africa, Mount Kilimanjara is also found in Tanzania.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tourism sector contributes approximately 17% of the country's GDP and 25% of all the foreign exchange revenues. This sector creates job oppurtunities for over 600,000 people directly and up to 2 million people indirectly. The revenue generated from Tourism has seen rapid increase over the years. The number of tourist arrivals has increased from about 500,000 in 2000 to over 1.1 million international visitors in 2014 mostly from Europe, US and Africa. Based on the govermnet's statistics, Tourism generated approximately 2.4 billion dollars in 2018. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this competition is to explore and build a linear regression model that will predict the spending behaivior of tourists visiting Tanzania.The model can be used by different tour operators and the Tanzania Tourism Board to automatically help tourists across the world estimate their expenditure before visiting Tanzania. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset describes 6476 rows of up-to-date information on tourist expenditure collected by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in Tanzania.The dataset was collected to gain a better understanding of the status of the tourism sector and provide an instrument that will enable sector growth.\n",
    "The survey covers seven departure points, namely: Julius Nyerere International Airport, Kilimanjaro International Airport, Abeid Amani Karume International Airport, and the Namanga, Tunduma, Mtukula and Manyovu border points.\n"
