    "## Context:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Tanzanian tourism sector plays a significant role in the Tanzanian economy, contributing about 17% to the countryâ€™s GDP and 25% of all foreign exchange revenues. The sector, which provides direct employment for more than 600,000 people and up to 2 million people indirectly, generated approximately $2.4 billion in 2018 according to government statistics. Tanzania received a record 1.1 million international visitor arrivals in 2014, mostly from Europe, the US and Africa.\n",
    "Tanzania is the only country in the world which has allocated more than 25% of its total area for wildlife, national parks, and protected areas.There are 16 national parks in Tanzania, 28 game reserves, 44 game-controlled areas, two marine parks and one conservation area.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this competition is to explore and build a linear regression model that will predict the spending behaivior of tourists visiting Tanzania.The model can be used by different tour operators and the Tanzania Tourism Board to automatically help tourists across the world estimate their expenditure before visiting Tanzania. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset describes 6476 rows of up-to-date information on tourist expenditure collected by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in Tanzania.The dataset was collected to gain a better understanding of the status of the tourism sector and provide an instrument that will enable sector growth.\n",
    "The survey covers seven departure points, namely: Julius Nyerere International Airport, Kilimanjaro International Airport, Abeid Amani Karume International Airport, and the Namanga, Tunduma, Mtukula and Manyovu border points.\n"
